      <td><i>Animal Farm</i></td>
      <td>1945</td>
      <td>George Orwell</td>
      <td>
        a story about farm arnimals revolting against the human farmers in an
        attempt to be self-controlled.
        the plan seems to be a success as the farm animals scare off the farmer,
        but as the story progresses, the pigs of the farm steadily take the role
        of the human farmer, the story ending with the other farm animals not
        being able to tell the difference between humans and pigs.
        this story is an allegory reflecting and criticizing the events of the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution">Russian Revolution of 1917</a>
        and the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">USSR</a>.

      <td><i>Free Will</i></td>
      <td>2012</td>
      <td>Sam Harris</td>
      <td>
        an argument refuting libertarian
        <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/">
        free will
        </a>
        and criticizing different strands of
        <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/">
        compatibilism
        </a>
        the basic argument is that any proclaimation of causation necessitates
        some explanation of the ontology of an object.
        in the case of libertarian free will, somehow humans avoid this
        requirement, which Harris argues is inconsistent.
        furthermore, some strands of compatibilism either mistake phenomenology
        for ontology or try to solely talk about free will only in terms of how
        it impacts moral responsibility, and hence is misleading.
        in fact, it is argued by Harris that a lack of free will is compatible
        with moral responsibility: "If we could incarcerate earthquakes and
        hurricanes for their crimes, we would build prisons for them as well. ...
        But the logic of punishing people will come undone &mdash; unless we
        find that punishment is an essential component of deterrence or reabilitation."
        very short book.

        some more notes/thoughts:
        compatibilists vary in their arguments.
        someone like Daniel Dennett, who Harris mentions often thoughout the
        text, claims that it might be possible for us to program machines which
        have the emergent property of free will.
        but if we fully understand the capabilities of such a computer program,
        in what way does it objectively have free will?
        one could surely say that such a machine would <i>feel</i> as if it has
        some sort of freedom.
        maybe this is what Dennett means?
        <b>if so, then fine ...</b>;
        we just need to be cautious of potential equivocations of the term.
        it does seem important to tread the fine line between hard
        deterministic views and the original theological conceptions of the phrase:
        i) the former ultimately leads to metaphysical anti-realism accounts,
        which in large part necessarily undermine human language, and ii) the
        latter notion was based off of the lack of a proper understanding of
        neuroscience, well at least if free will has anything to do with the
        brain/command center.
        the terms "decision" and "choice" are still accurate without free will:
        we all <i>decide</i> to take action, but we do not need to state our decision
        or choice was free from bias, since decisions without libertarian free
        will necessitate bias.
        a phrase like "actor A should have performed action X instead of action Y"
        does not mean
        that A had the capability to perform X instead of Y <i>in the past moment</i>,
        but that it instead would behoove A to <i>consider</i> performing X instead
        of Y in <i>similar future scenarios</i>, i.e. the ability to easily
        <i>augment</i> the weights of A's decision making process without a large
        expenditure of energy from other actors.
        importantly, these ideas are not violating causation and are less
        susceptible to equivocations of free will that give an unattainable degree
        of moral responsibility.
        so in conclusion, the term "free will" employed by various compatibilists
        is vague and prone to unwarranted equivocations,
        some of which might lead to the stagnation of moral progress.
        a better term to use would be "decision" or "choice", and the people
        advocating this would be called "soft determinists", a term on which
        Harris and Dennett's ideas seem to converge.

      <td><i>Utilitarianism</i></td>
      <td>1861</td>
      <td>John Stuart Mill</td>
      <td>
        a defense of utilitarianism.
        there are lots of criticisms of utilitarianism, and Mill tries to show
        why the criticisms fail.
        It seems that most criticisms fail to distinguish the act from the actor.
        Mill argues that when trying to decide which action is favorable, we
        should look at the outcome that has the most desirable consequences.
        further, desirability is intrisically tied to the exemption of pains
        and the invitation of pleasures (or happiness).
        Mill's version of utilitarianism differs from Bentham's purely hedonistic
        utilitarianism; he argues that there are different measures of
        pleasure and pain (such a quality and quantity) that we ought to
        take into account: "It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a
        pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied.
        And if the fool, or the pig, is of a different opinion, it is because
        they only know their own side of the question."
        short book, but relatively difficult to read.

        some more thoughts:
        Henry Sidgwick has some work picking apart both Bentham's and Mill's
        versions of utilitarianism,
        attempting to show incompatibility between egoistic and universal hedonism.

        genes, memes, and evolutionary game theory: an argument for a

        fantastic writing, especially with the abstractions of the

        Dawkins says that <i>The Immortal Gene</i> would have made for a more
        accurate title as the contents of the book are purely descriptive.

      <td>
        an attempt to criticize and invoke skepticism on the concept of prisons.
        the work draws upon parallels of other hieracrchical systems (such as
        human slavery and gender inequality) to show similarities in both the
        flaws of such systems and how the early stages of each of their justice 
        movements (abolitionist and women's rights movements, resp.) were
        treated by the people during the respective eras.
        Davis shows how prison <i>abolition</i> differs from prison <i>reform</i>
        and deals with other common criticisms.
