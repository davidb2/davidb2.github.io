        a story about farm arnimals revolting against the human farmers in an
        attempt to be self-controlled.
        the plan seems to be a success as the farm animals scare off the farmer,
        but as the story progresses, the pigs of the farm steadily take the role
        of the human farmer, the story ending with the other farm animals not
        being able to tell the difference between humans and pigs.
        this story is an allegory reflecting and criticizing the events of the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution">Russian Revolution of 1917</a>
        and the

      <td><i>Free Will</i></td>
      <td>2012</td>
      <td>Sam Harris</td>
      <td>
        an argument refuting libertarian
        <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/">
        free will
        </a>
        and criticizing different strands of
        <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/">
        compatibilism
        </a>
        the basic argument is that any proclaimation of causation necessitates
        some explanation of the ontology of an object.
        in the case of libertarian free will, somehow humans avoid this
        requirement, which Harris argues is inconsistent.
        furthermore, some strands of compatibilism either mistake phenomenology
        for ontology or try to solely talk about free will only in terms of how
        it impacts moral responsibility, and hence is misleading.
        in fact, it is argued by Harris that a lack of free will is compatible
        with moral responsibility: "If we could incarcerate earthquakes and
        hurricanes for their crimes, we would build prisons for them as well. ...
        But the logic of punishing people will come undone &mdash; unless we
        find that punishment is an essential component of deterrence or reabilitation."
        very short book.
        ---
        some more notes/thoughts:
        compatibilists vary in their arguments.
        someone like Daniel Dennett, who Harris mentions often thoughout the
        text, claims that it might be possible for us to program machines which
        have the emergent property of free will.
        but if we fully understand the capabilities of such a computer program,
        in what way does it objectively have free will?
        one could surely say that such a machine would <i>feel</i> as if it has
        some sort of freedom.
        maybe this is what Dennett means?
        if so, then fine ...;
        we just need to be cautious of potential equivocations of the term.
        it does seem important to tread the fine line between hard
        deterministic views and the original theological conceptions of the phrase:
        i) the former ultimately leads to metaphysical anti-realism accounts,
        which in large part necessarily undermine language, and ii) the
        latter notion was based off of the lack of a proper understanding of
        neuroscience, well at least if free will has anything to do with the
        brain/command center.
        the terms "decision" and "choice" are still accurate without free will:
        we all <i>decide</i> to take action, but we do not need to state our decision
        or choice was free from bias, since decisions without libertarian free
        will necessitate bias.
        a phrase like "actor A should have performed action X instead of action Y"
        does not mean
        that A had the capability to perform X instead of Y <i>in the past moment</i>,
        but that it instead would behoove A to <i>consider</i> performing X instead
        of Y in <i>similar future scenarios</i>, i.e. the ability to easily
        <i>augment</i> the weights of A's decision making process without a large
        expenditure of energy from other objects, a form of self-control.
        importantly, these ideas are not violating causation and are less
        susceptible to equivocations of free will that give an unattainable degree
        of moral responsibility.
        so in conclusion, the term "free will" employed by various
        compatibilists is vague and prone to unwarranted equivocations,
        some of which might lead to the stagnation of moral progress.
        a better term to use would be "decision" or "choice", and the
        compatibilists advocating this would be called "soft determinists",
        a term on which Harris and Dennett's ideas seem to converge.
        further, the contemporary conversation around free will is fundamentally
        flawed at best, and is focused on unimportant issues
        (e.g. ex nihilo causation).

      <td><i>Utilitarianism</i></td>
      <td>1861</td>
      <td>John Stuart Mill</td>
      <td>
        a defense of utilitarianism.
        there are lots of criticisms of utilitarianism, and Mill tries to show
        why the criticisms fail.
        It seems that most criticisms fail to distinguish the act from the actor.
        Mill argues that when trying to decide which action is favorable, we
        should look at the outcome that has the most desirable consequences.
        further, desirability is intrisically tied to the exemption of pains
        and the invitation of pleasures (or happiness).
        Mill's version of utilitarianism differs from Bentham's purely hedonistic
        utilitarianism; he argues that there are different measures of
        pleasure and pain (such a quality and quantity) that we ought to
        take into account: "It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a
        pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied.
        And if the fool, or the pig, is of a different opinion, it is because
        they only know their own side of the question."
        short book, but relatively difficult to read.
        ---
        some more thoughts:
        Henry Sidgwick has some work picking apart both Bentham's and Mill's
        versions of utilitarianism,
        attempting to show incompatibility between egoistic and universal hedonism.

        genes, memes, and evolutionary game theory: an argument for a
        gene-centered perspective of natural selection and evolution.
        ---
        some more thoughts:
        fantastic writing, especially with the abstractions of the
        vehicles vs. the replicators.
        Dawkins says that <i>The Immortal Gene</i> would have made for a more
        accurate title as the contents of the book are purely descriptive.
        arguments in the book take a similar form:
        <ol>
          <li> what do we observe in nature? </li>
          <li> is there an interpretation of this observation at the level of the genes? </li>
          <li> does this interpretation match previous observations well?
               is this interpretation provide as much or more prediction utility
               than non-kin selection theories (e.g., group selection)?
               if not, go back to 2. or maybe even 1. </li>
          <li> what predictions does this interpretation entail? </li>
        </ol>
        to make these arguments more rigorous, Dawkins gives plenty of
        examples of how evolutionary biology research has utilized
        John Maynard Smith's work on evolutionary game theory. 
        an <b><i>evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS)</i></b> is an agent model
        in which
        small perturbations to the proportions of available types of agents
        will not disturb the existing dynamic.
        we can think of this as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>if a type of agent is rare, it must succeed well against the more
          popular types of agents;</li>
          <li>if a type of agent is abundant, it must succeed well against agents
          of its own type.</li>
        </ul>
        ESSs are not necessarily unique and do not necessarily need to exist.
        an even stranger property is that an ESS need not be the "best" strategy
        in the sense that they do not necessarily (and often do not) maximize
        the overall welfare utility.
        also, ESSs are not necessarily unbeatable: they are only necessarily
        <i>uninvadeable</i>.
        ESSs can explain replicators' amplificatory phenotypical properties
        (e.g. sexed individuals among species).
        the idea behind kin selection is that an agent places weight on its
        interests directly proportional to the amount of shared genetic material.
        in lots of animals and plants, siblings share 1/2 half of there genetic
        material in expectation, aunts/uncles 1/4, first cousins 1/8, etc.;
        children 1/2, grandchildren 1/4, great-grandchildren 1/8, etc.;
        parents 1/2, grandparents 1/4, great-grandparents 1/8, etc.;
        we are assuming some (possibly unwarranted) independence here.
        but remember, this is only if in expectation relatedness is 1/2 between
        direct family members.
        this is not always the case.
        for example, haplodiploidy is a system in which relatedness is asymmetric:
        mother-daughter and father-daughter relatedness is both 1/2 (symmetric),
        but a son is related to his mother 1/2, a mother son has 100% relatedness,
        a father cannot have a son,
        brothers are related 1/2, sisters are related 3/4.
        all of this asymmetry leads to atypical behavior dynamics.

        one of the shorter chapters towards the end of the book talk about the
        new replicators, memes, which can evolve by non-genetic means, and at a
        rate even faster than genetic evolution.
        memes are cultural units that spread between brains.
        our brains are full of these memes (e.g. ideas, catch-phrases, beliefs, etc.)
        and great memes are focused on fecundity (like genes).
        one <i>possible*</i> example is the English catch phrase
        "i could care less!", spoken when presented with a perceived uninteresting
        potential conversational avenue: the intention of the phrase does not match
        its semantic properties; the phrase "i could <b>not</b> care less!" would
        make much more sense.
        however, it must be something with the rhythm, meter, and most
        descriptively, the cadence of the consonance (voiceless velar plosive)
        of the former phrase that causes it to be more likely to be immitated;
        this is one explanation from a linguistic perspective that may or may
        not be true.

        some more thoughts:
        very well-written. one of the conclusions reached by Singer is that if
        if we think that the value of human life is generally
        equal, then we should reflect this thinking when spending and donating
        money.
        this means that it becomes unjustified to place welfare priority of people
        of your community above people of other communities.

      <td><i>The Ego Tunnel: The Science of the Mind and the Myth of the Self</i></td>
      <td>2009</td>
      <td>Thomas Metzinger</td>
      <td>
        a presentation about advances in neuroscience
        that give strong evidence against the concept of the "self." 
        Metzinger examines phenomenological studies and other research in
        neuroscience to come to the following thesis:
        consciuousness is the ability for a system to represent itself just like
        it does with its surroundings.
        as a corollary, conscious beings are unable to <i>experience</i> a
        complete loss of the phenomenonal self-model (PSM)
        (whose content is the "ego") because there would be no one experiencing
        it.
        this is most likely what happens during certain phases of sleep in
        certain animals.
        however, Metzinger argues, it is possible to experience both a partial
        loss in the PSM and a physical extension of oneself.
        towards the end of the book, Metzinger proposes a new type of ethics,
        "consciuousness ethics", so that society can focus on the science of
        consciuousness without "sliding back into various forms of irrationalism
        and fundamentalism."
        ---
        some more notes/thoughts:
        took the ethical concerns more seriously than other similar books on the
        matter, though it was mainly raise questions rather than answering them.
        another interpretation of the book's thesis: religious and spiritual
        experiences are real in the phenomenological sense and can be explained
        using solely a materialistic framework (as opposed to idealism, dualism, etc.).
        thus, we can use this information about consciuousness to improve the
        world without the usual dogma and baggage found in ancient traditions.
        however, there are serious ethical implications associated with the
        topic.

        also, Metzinger says that we will not be able to necessarily have a
        precise mathematical formulation of every possible brain state for humans;
        this is because i) humans are good at distinguishing, but are terrible
        at truly remembering sensations, and ii) the phenomenon of so called
        "qualia" is necessarily ineffable: we cannot describe our own systems
        because that would require a loss of the PSM.
        but, we should in theory be able to determine the degree of
        consciuousness in a system.
        as an example, feed forward artificial networks that are DAGs have no
        capability for consciuousness; it does not mean they cannot "display"
        intelligent behavior though.

        in the final chapters, Metzinger refutes Robert Nozick's
        "Experience Machine" argument against hedonism.
        since it seems that people did not want to be hooked up to such a machine
        that keeps the patient in a permanent state of happiness, it seems that
        there are better experiences than just happiness
        (e.g., truth, virtue, art, dignity, etc).
        now, without addressing potential faults in this intuition pump,
        Metzinger accepts a sort of conclusion from this: ego machines do not
        want necessarily to be bliss machines.
        however, it does not seem as if there is an experience one would want to
        experience if it were known to be followed by a permanent state of
        suffering. 
        what follows is a rather unsettling pessimistic view: the bad experiences
        seem to outweigh the good experiences.
        from this, Metzinger concludes that we ought not create artificial ego
        machines.
