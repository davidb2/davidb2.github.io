      <td>1945</td>

      <td>
        a story about farm arnimals revolting against the human farmers in an
        attempt to be self-controlled.
        the plan seems to be a success as the farm animals scare off the farmer,
        but as the story progresses, the pigs of the farm steadily take the role
        of the human farmer, the story ending with the other farm animals not
        being able to tell the difference between humans and pigs.
        this story is an allegory reflecting and criticizing the events of the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution">Russian Revolution of 1917</a>
        and the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">USSR</a>.

        genes, memes, and evolutionary game theory: an argument for a
        gene-centered perspective of natural selection and evolution.
        fantastic writing, especially with the abstractions of the
        vehicles vs. the replicators.
        Dawkins says that <i>The Immortal Gene</i> would have made for a more
        accurate title as the contents of the book are purely descriptive.

        an overview of what we know about the neocortex,

        the third part of the book speculates about the future of intelligence:
