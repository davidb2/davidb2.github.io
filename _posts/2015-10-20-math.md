[_The Price is Right_ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Price_Is_Right)
is an American game show wherein contestants bid on various prizes.
Roughly speaking, in each round, the contestant whose bid is closest to the
actual cost of prize wins the prize.
Though there is one caveat: if a contestant overvalues the prices, he will be
guaranteed not to win the prize.
To make the game more fun, the contestants often get advice for the bid from the
audience.

Consider the following variation of the game:
  * There is only one contestant.
    Before starting the game, the contestant chooses $$n$$ audience members to
    help advise him throughout the game.
  * There are $$T$$ rounds in total.
  * In round $$t$$, the game show host presents the prize along with a suggested
    price $$q_t$$ and width $$k_t$$; the actual price $$p_t$$ is kept secret.
    The contestant must determine whether $$|p_t-q_t|\leq k_t$$.
    In other words, the contestant needs to determine if the price of the prize
    is close to what the price the host suggested.
  * Before making his decision, the contestant can get advice from the $$n$$
    pre-selected audience members.

What strategy should the contestant employ to minimize the number of rounds he
loses?

From here on out, I will refer to the $$n$$ audience members as _experts_ since
they are giving advice.
If the contestant loses a round, we say that this is a _mistake_.
Similarly, if an expert gives incorrect advice for a round, we say that this is
a _mistake_.
Also, _we_ are going to play as the contestant (to make the wording more clear).

#### Scenarios

##### A Perfect Expert
Suppose that out of the $$n$$ experts we choose, there is at least one expert
who always gives the correct advice in each round.

**Theorem 1.** <i>There is a strategy such that at most $$\log_2 n$$ rounds are
lost.</i>

**Proof:** We decide using majority vote.
If an expert gives incorrect advice, we do not consider their vote in future
rounds.
Let $$n_t$$ be the number of experts whose advice is to be considered at
round $$t$$ where $$n_0=n$$.
If at round $$t$$ a _majority_ of the considered experts make a mistake
$$n_{t+1} \leq n_t/2$$.
Thus after $$\log_2 n$$ wrong decisions made, at most
$$n_0/2^{\log_2 n} = 1$$ expert is left: a perfect expert.

##### Arbitrary Experts
Now we think of the setting where the experts are arbitrary.

One strategy would be to ignore the experts and randomly (uniformly) make a
decision.
This strategy will yield $$T/2$$ rounds lost in expectation.

After $$t$$ rounds, let $$m_i^{(t)}$$ be the number of mistakes that expert
$$i$$ has made and $$m^{(t)}$$ be the number of mistakes we have made.
Surprisingly, the following result holds:

**Theorem 2.** <i>There is a strategy such that
$$m^{(t)} \leq \frac{2\ln n}{\varepsilon} + 2(1+\varepsilon)m_i^{(t)}$$
for every $$\varepsilon \in (0, 1]$$, $$i\in [n]$$, and $$t\in [T]$$.
</i>

In particular, this is saying that we can _approximately_ perform at
least as well as the best expert.

**Proof:** We generalize the majority vote algorithm:
