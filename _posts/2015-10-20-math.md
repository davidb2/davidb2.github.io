  title="The Price is Right">

[_The Price is Right_ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Price_Is_Right)
is an American game show wherein contestants bid on various prizes.
Roughly speaking, in each round, the contestant whose bid is closest to the
actual cost of prize wins the prize.
Though there is one caveat: if a contestant overvalues the prices, he will be
guaranteed not to win the prize.
To make the game more fun, the contestants often get advice for the bid from the
audience.

Consider the following variation of the game:
  * There is only one contestant.
    Before starting the game, the contestant chooses $$n$$ audience members to
    help advise him throughout the game.
  * There are $$T$$ rounds in total.
  * In round $$t$$, the game show host presents the prize along with a suggested
    price $$q_t$$ and width $$k_t$$; the actual price $$p_t$$ is kept secret.
    The contestant must determine whether $$|p_t-q_t|\leq k_t$$.
    In other words, the contestant needs to determine if the price of the prize
    is close to what the price the host suggested.
  * Before making his decision, the contestant can get advice from the $$n$$
    pre-selected audience members.
  * After the contestant makes the decision, the host tells him whether his
    answer was correct or mistaken.

Here is an example round:
> Host: [Shows a 2020 Toyota Prius]. "Does this car cost $22,000 &#177; 4000?"
>
> Contestant: [Consults audience members]. "Yes."
>
> Host: "You are correct! The price is $24,525."

In this example, $$q_t = 22000$$, $$k_t=4000$$, and $$p_t=24525$$.

What strategy should the contestant employ to minimize the number of rounds he
loses?

---

From here on out, I will refer to the $$n$$ audience members as _experts_ since
they are giving advice.
If the contestant loses a round, we say that this is a _mistake_.
Similarly, if an expert gives incorrect advice for a round, we say that this is
a _mistake_.
Also, _we_ are going to play as the contestant (to make the wording more clear).

#### Scenarios

##### A Perfect Expert
Suppose that out of the $$n$$ experts we choose, there is at least one expert
who always gives the correct advice in each round.

**Theorem 1.** <i>There is a strategy such that at most $$\log_2 n$$ rounds are
lost.</i>

**Proof:** We decide using majority vote.
If an expert gives incorrect advice, we do not consider their vote in future
rounds.
Let $$n_t$$ be the number of experts whose advice is to be considered at
round $$t$$ where $$n_0=n$$.
If at round $$t$$ a _majority_ of the considered experts make a mistake
$$n_{t+1} \leq n_t/2$$.
Thus after $$\log_2 n$$ wrong decisions made, at most
$$n_0/2^{\log_2 n} = 1$$ expert is left: a perfect expert.

##### Arbitrary Experts
Now we think of the setting where the experts are arbitrary.

One strategy would be to ignore the experts and randomly (uniformly) make a
decision.
This strategy will yield $$T/2$$ rounds lost in expectation.

After $$t$$ rounds, let $$m_i^{(t)}$$ be the number of mistakes that expert
$$i$$ has made and $$m^{(t)}$$ be the number of mistakes we have made.
Surprisingly, the following result holds:

**Theorem 2.** <i>There is a strategy such that
$$m^{(t)} \leq \frac{2\ln n}{\varepsilon} + 2(1+\varepsilon)m_i^{(t)}$$
for every $$\varepsilon \in (0, 1/2)$$, $$i\in [n]$$, and $$t\in [T]$$.
</i>

In particular, this is saying that we can _approximately_ perform at
least as well as the best expert.

**Proof:** We generalize the majority vote algorithm:
  1. Each expert $$i$$ has a "reliability" weight $$w_i^{(t)}$$ for each round $$t$$ such that $$w_i^{(0)}=1$$.
  2. During each round, we choose the answer whose combined supporting experts
     has the largest total weight (i.e. a _weighted_ majority vote).
  3. If we learn that an expert makes a mistake in round $$t$$, we subtract
     off $$\varepsilon w_i^{(t)}$$ from their weight so that
     $$w_i^{(t+1)} \gets (1-\varepsilon)w_i^{(t)}$$.
     Otherwise, their weight goes untouched.

Let $$\Phi^{(t)} = \sum_i w_i^{(t)}$$.
We are going to bound $$\Phi^{(t+1)}$$ below and above.
  * (below) Notice that $$\Phi^{(t+1)}\geq w_i^{(t+1)}$$.
    By induction, one can observe that
    $$w_i^{(t+1)} = (1-\varepsilon)^{m_i^{(t)}}$$,
    thus $$\Phi^{(t+1)}\geq (1-\varepsilon)^{m_i^{(t)}}$$.
  * (above) Notice that if in round $$t$$ we make a mistake, that means that
    the weighted majority of the experts made a mistake.
    This means that the sum of all of the experts' weights is decreased by at
    least $$(\varepsilon/2)\Phi^{(t)}$$.
    Thus by induction, $$\Phi^{(t+1)}\leq (1-\varepsilon/2)^{m^{(t)}}n$$.
    We can bound $$1-\varepsilon/2$$ above by $$\exp(-\varepsilon/2)$$ by
    convexity to get $$\Phi^{(t+1)}\leq n\cdot\exp(-\varepsilon m^{(t)}/2)$$.

Now we have that $$(1-\varepsilon)^{m_i^{(t)}} \leq \Phi^{(t+1)} \leq n\cdot\exp(-\varepsilon m^{(t)}/2)$$.
Apply the natural logarithm to the left and right sides to get
$$m^{(t)}\leq 2\left(\frac{\ln n}{\varepsilon} - \frac{\ln (1-\varepsilon)}{\varepsilon}\right)$$.
Finally, use the fact that $$-\ln(1-\varepsilon)\leq \varepsilon(1+\varepsilon)$$
for $$\varepsilon \in (0, 1/2)$$ (hint: look at Taylor series expansion) to arrive
at the conclusion.

One can do better with a randomized strategy, removing the factor of $$2$$ from
the RHS.
 
**Theorem 3.** <i>There is a strategy such that
$$\mathbb E\,m^{(t)} \leq \frac{\ln n}{\varepsilon} + (1+\varepsilon)m_i^{(t)}$$
for every $$\varepsilon \in (0, 1/2)$$, $$i\in [n]$$, and $$t\in [T]$$.
