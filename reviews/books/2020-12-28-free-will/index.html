<p><img alt="Free Will (2012) - Sam Harris" height="200px" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71M+MkYZA9L.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;" title="Free Will (2012) - Sam Harris" /></p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>: American cognitive neuroscientist
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Harris">Sam Harris</a>
attempts to convince the reader that the idea of free will does not exist.
He further goes on to claim that free will is typically a misnomer for others’
beliefs.
Harris compares and contrasts the philosophical ideas of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism">determinism</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism">compatibilism</a>,
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism_(metaphysics)">libertarianism</a>.
Harris concludes that libertarianism has no scientific support and rather spends
some time showing how compatibilists play a sleight of hand:
“[Compatibilists] trade a psychological fact for a conceptual understanding of
ourselves as persons.”
In other words, the compatibilist’s argument is essentially:
“A puppet is free as long as he loves his strings.”
While arguing for his disbelief in free will, Harris claims that the lack of
free will is even compatible with the belief of a
metaphysical presence.
Harris gives some evidence of his claims by referencing scientific experiments
that might convince the reader of the reality of causality.
Later on in the book, Harris considers the reader to think of the implications
of no free will and specifically how society ought to treat others with regards
to crime, punishment, justice, and welfare.</p>

<p><strong>My familiarity with the author and the topic before reading the book</strong>: I am
very familiar with Harris and his ideas through his appearances on podcasts, so
I acknowledge that my opinion of the book is heavily biased.
I have informally discussed the topic of the book many times with others, but
this is the first time I have been exposed to the topic on a more formal level.</p>

<p><strong>Writing style</strong>: Harris explains terms in a manner that many others will
easily understand.
The book is very short and concise which is a benefit.
I’m a terribly slow reader (I have to read each word aloud in my head to fully
understand the text), but I was able to finish the text in an afternoon
with a solid understanding of the ideas conveyed.
I noticed that Harris seemed to rely heavily on the punctuation marks used
throughout the book, almost as if he were trying hard to speak conversationally
with the reader.
I enjoyed this natural conversational flow, but it can sometimes get confusing
being nested in parentheses and em-dashes without being able to hear any speech
intonation.
I think it is important to sacrifice grammar correctness for colloquial language
if it allows for a better transfer of thoughts.</p>

<p>I understand that the discussion of this topic is difficult to convey through
text, but the book is littered with some ramblings about the nature of causality
applied to Harris’s actions.
These ramblings were mostly in the form of suggestive questions and Harris
seemed to be implying implicitly that the reader should fill in the details
surrounding the answers to his questions.
This is an effective method as a catalyst for self-reflection, though it
typically does not objectively answer any questions.
It is good that Harris did not solely rely on these rhetorical questions to
serve as evidence for his conclusion, otherwise, the book would not be of much
rigor.
I am always skeptical of arguments whose foundation is solely intuition because
human intuition can be deeply flawed.</p>

<p><strong>Some of the arguments of the book (and my commentary)</strong>: Harris defends his
claims well with scientific evidence and deduction.
The central claim of the book is the idea that humans take action in their lives
because they either want to or are forced into doing so.
According to Harris’s logic, if you decide to take action on something that you
did not want to do and you were not forced to perform this action, then this is
simply your wanting to not wanting to take an action
(read that again very carefully).
This, as he explains, is the inescapable truth of causality:
you have no control over your desires, and thus we are all merely controlled by
biochemical processes.
I don’t think that this argument is necessarily convincing standing on its own,
but Harris gives some scientific arguments.</p>

<p>In my opinion, Harris’s strongest arguments are those which rely on neuroscience
and psychological evidence.
For instance, Harris talks about experiments where scientists can accurately
predict the choice a subject will make before they act by solely monitoring the
subject’s brain activity.
The amount of time between the prediction varies from study to study, but it
ranges from 30 milliseconds to 7 seconds.
There is an annotated bibliography at the end of the book and in-text citations
are used throughout the text;
I won’t be referencing any material in this review.</p>

<p>Well, what about the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">Uncertainty Principle</a>?
Harris defines the term <em>free will</em> as the ability for a human to have taken a
different action in the past, according to their desires (e.g. will).
So if we cannot accurately predict the state of a particle given all of the
initial conditions, how is it possible to act according to one’s desires?
It would seem that the term “free will” is a misnomer in this case since it
would seem impossible to fully understand one’s own behavior.
Admittedly, I do not know much about the Uncertainty Principle, so I cannot
comment much on this argument.
Though, I think it is a reasonable deduction that free will at the very least is
a misnomer in this case.</p>

<p>In the latter half of the book, Harris talks about the implications of having no
free will.
This part of the book was by far my favorite:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“To see how fully our moral intuitions must shift, consider what would happen
if we discovered a cure for human evil.
Imagine that every relevant change in the human brain could now be made
cheaply, painlessly, and safely.
In fact, the cure could be put directly into the food supply, like vitamin D.
Evil would become nothing of a nutritional deficiency.
If we imagine a cure for evil exists, we can see that our retributive impulse
[to punish criminals] is morally flawed.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He gives many more thought experiments to allow the reader to try to question
what predicates an instinct to punish criminals rather than to long for
rehabilitation.
Harris points out the reader’s inconsistency in cases where the defendant is
truly insane concerning mental state and capacity.
Harris is mainly talking about the US, though it seems that the ability for a
defendant to plead insanity in state courts is for each state to decide
(<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14781352605474707446">Kahler v. Kansas (2020)</a>).
But why do we hold views that a defendant with a recurring or persistent
psychiatric disease should not be held responsible for their criminal actions?
Surely, if we could fully understand the cause of the defendant’s actions and
demonstrate its reproducibility, would the defendant truly be held responsible
for their actions?
Rather, we would treat these criminals as merely “unlucky” people.
Harris mentions that we could still restrain violent criminals for the interest
of societal well-being, but under this lens of causality, it would seem
morally inconsistent to
“[withhold] the cure for evil […] as a part of [a criminal’s] punishment.”</p>

<p>The US Supreme Court
(<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=787130527265701764">Morissette v. United States (1952)</a>)
says that free will is “universal and persistent in mature
systems of law” and is the “consequent ability and duty of the normal individual
to choose between good and evil.”
The US Supreme Court
(<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=238211167095773011">United States v. Grayson (1978)</a>)
also says that determinism is
“inconsistent with the underlying precepts of our criminal justice system.”
The implications of discovering free will to be false ought to cause a
fundamental change in the way the justice system works, even in the words of the
US Supreme Court.
In the chapter titled “Moral Responsibility”, Harris does a fantastic job
questioning why our society blindly operates as if free will exists.</p>

<p><strong>Something new I learned</strong>: The US criminal justice system operates with the
assumption that humans have free will.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: If you are not familiar with the concepts of determinism
or free will, then this is a good book to read to gain perspective.
If you are familiar, some of the chapters might not be useful,
but I highly recommend at least reading Harris’s discussion in the chapter
titled “Moral Responsibility”.</p>

<h5 id="epistemic-metrics">Epistemic Metrics</h5>

<p><strong>How strongly were you convinced of the author’s argument before reading the
book?</strong>:
I pretty much had the same beliefs as Harris before reading the book based on
the science that we know so far.
There is most likely human exceptionalism
(whose truthfulness lacks scientific evidence/rigor) at play, so I am very
skeptical of the claims libertarianism asserts.
So while I’m not completely convinced by the argument, I think that these views
far outweigh competing contemporary views based on the
scientific evidence we have so far in terms of truthfulness. 
At the very least, the conversation surrounding free will is most likely stalled
at the definitions used.</p>

<p><em>Note: I should say that the word “convinced” may be a poor choice: I am never
fully convinced of anything. For all practical purposes, I agree with the
author’s claims in the book.</em></p>

<p><strong>How did the author’s argument affect the strength of the belief you previously
held?</strong>:
My views on the truthfulness of free will have not changed much.
However, my views on justice and human welfare have changed a bit following some
of the discussions that Harris made. 
I would like to read more about compatibilism.</p>

<p><strong>What piece of evidence would make you more convinced of the author’s
arguments?</strong>:
Reading some more scientific experiments on the topic
would further convince me.
I would also like to see experiments where the scientists were not able to
predict the actions of the subjects with high accuracy.
I think it would be necessary to have some experiments testing the claim of free
will.
We could conduct short experiments that measure the amount a person attributes
their completion of a predefined task to their starting conditions,
having the scientists alter the starting conditions for different subjects.
Harris mentioned his colleague <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett">Daniel Dennett</a>
quite often and Dennett’s compatibilism views;
I’ll read through his thoughts on the topic if I gain the will …</p>
